# Sly 1 port restart checkpoint

Updated: 2026-11-07, after commit `c36f40b`. Work in
`/home/reaper/sly/OpenThievius` on branch
`wip/native-sly-port`. The user wants frequent commits and pushes. Keep the
port-only functional C backfills under `port/game/sly1-us/hand/native_c/` and
registered in `backfills.tsv`; do not put those replacements in
`/home/reaper/Code/sly1-decomp`. Continue using native runs only; no emulator
is involved in the port work.

## State

- Latest pushed commit at this update: `c36f40b debug(sly1): trace packed render sections`.
- The checkout was clean and matched `origin/wip/native-sly-port` when this
  update was written.
- The local decomp checkout `/home/reaper/Code/sly1-decomp` was fetched and
  checked: clean `master` at `e1b39f1 feat(us): match small function batch`;
  the routines relevant to the current object/render investigation were still
  in progress there.
- Build succeeded with 2,043 translated C functions, 222 assembly
  translations, and zero stubs. Rebuild generated code with
  `cmake --build build/port --target port_native -j2` after hostgen changes.

## Actual graphics blocker

The native window starts, but the current level probe produces no scene
vertices or visible text. The direct `OPENRAC_BOOT_LEVEL=0x0100` probe reaches
loader stage 5 but does not connect that loaded world to gameplay. Five outer
groups (`0x00fe903c`, `0x00fe942c`, `0x00fe981c`, `0x00fe9c0c`,
`0x00fe9ffc`) remain skipped by their resource flag; preserve that retail
behavior. A separate render list has an unskipped entry at `0x00847ce0` with
three primary records. Their descriptor at `0x0083f4b0` points to three
nonzero 32-byte blocks at `0x0064d6e0`, `0x0064d8e0`, and `0x0064dae0`, but
the retail packet builder outputs only command tags and zero DMA addresses.
The exact pointer chain and sample bytes are now written in
`docs/port/SLY_GRAPHICS_HANDOFF.md`, so `/tmp` captures are not required to
resume. Exact US assembly is also enabled for `func_001DC9A0`, the 800-byte
level effect initializer that had been an empty no-C stub. The latest bounded
run remains frame state 3/game mode 0 with zero scene vertices.

Useful captures, if `/tmp` survives restart:
`/tmp/sly-native-direct0100-mesh-sections.log`,
`/tmp/sly-native-direct0100-packet-dump.log`,
`/tmp/sly-native-direct0100-dc9a0-asm.log`,
`/tmp/sly-native-direct0100-render-groups-final.log`, and
`/tmp/sly-watch-entry-flag-detail.log`. Read
`docs/port/SLY_GRAPHICS_HANDOFF.md` and
`docs/port/PLAYABLE_TODO.md` before repeating older probes; they contain prior
startup, rendering, and decomp coverage findings.

## Resume here

Trace the producer and consumer of the three packed blocks above and establish
why the unskipped render-list entry has zero DMA addresses. Do not force the
skipped groups or synthesize packet data. Separately trace the normal
Splash-to-title/New Game transition; normal startup still stays on Splash
(frame state 3/game mode 0) and does not reach the opening sequence or title.
Keep the direct-level probe diagnostic-only. Keep all functional C replacements
as clearly labeled port-only backfills, separate from matching decompilation.

Native launcher command used for the direct-level probe:

```sh
OPENRAC_BOOT_LEVEL=0x0100 build/port/sly1_native \
  build/port/extracted/boot/SCUS_971.98 \
  '/home/reaper/pcsx2/Games/Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (USA).iso'
```

The native window opening successfully is not a playable or visible milestone.
