# Native port roadmap

The port and the matching decompilation can progress together. A complete
matching decompilation is not required to begin tooling, asset research or a
viewer, but native gameplay needs hostable C along its boot and frame paths.
See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and open decisions.

| Phase | Work | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Decide source-generation boundary and host memory model; inspect reusable OpenRAC tooling and license | A small Sly source subset can be prepared without modifying sly1-decomp |
| 1 | Read-only source integration, build scaffolding and frontier reporting | The port can build a host test program from generated Sly code |
| 2 | Research the retail loader/index; implement disc validation, extraction and asset format notes | A user's own disc is validated and game files can be located safely |
| 3 | Derive asset readers/converters from Sly's retail code | Port-ready level and texture assets from a user's disc |
| 4 | Native viewer and renderer prototypes for Sly's actual rendering systems | An extracted Sly scene draws without running game code |
| 5 | Replace required platform APIs and host the boot/title path | Native program reaches a useful in-game state |
| 6 | Complete frame path, renderer integration, audio, input and saves | NTSC-U is playable on desktop platforms |
| 7 | PAL support, parity fixes, packaging and launcher | Both retail versions are supported |

**Current implementation:** the hostgen tool and CMake entry point are in
place. With local retail-backed assembly available, the latest run translated
1,532 functions from C and 3,147 from assembly; all 81 generated C units
compile. `port_native` reads a user's extracted boot ELF and optional ISO,
maps the ELF segments, and calls the translated entry. The launcher accepts
Sly's `SetupThread` stack range, registers five constructor-table interior
callbacks, and runs guest worker threads on host threads with separate guest
stacks. A native ISO 9660 reader accepts cooked images and raw 2352-byte BINs,
locates paths, and reads file ranges. The IOP bootstrap constructor has a
native CD-ready hook, and file open/poll/close use ISO lookup. The native DMA
helper performs validated EE RAM copies synchronously; interrupt handlers,
semaphores and CP0 timer reads have basic host implementations. SIF SetReg and
GetReg (syscalls 0x79 and 0x7A) use a host-side register map. The SIF RPC bind
loop is bypassed for native startup. Native startup publishes SIF BOOTEND and
CMDINIT at register 4 (value 0x60000), with an opaque subaddress, when the
disc-backed IOP replacement starts. Native SIF command handling completes
command-init and binds both guest RPC clients. In the latest bounded run,
startup reached its first service request (service `0x00123456`, RPC 0) and
waited on worker thread 5 for the IOP reply. SIF DMA (0x76–0x78), IOP
RPC service responses, renderer, frame loop,
input, audio, saves and remaining disc/device services still block gameplay.
The source bridge also has unreadable source files and C++ constructs that need
preserving; continue along the loader and boot call graph, grounding host
behavior in retail code or public hardware documentation.

The order can change as source research reveals dependencies. Keep each phase
grounded in evidence from Sly's retail code. Continue function matching in
`sly1-decomp`; prioritize functions and data on the loader, boot, frame and
rendering paths once those paths are identified. Generated code and game
assets stay in ignored local build/data directories.
